# MERN-Stack-Restaurant-Application
-> This is a Full Stack Restaurant Reservation Application created using React, Node, MongoDB, and Express.<br>
-> The Application displays and markets details of the Restaurant like 'Services', 'Popular Dishes', 'Expertise', and the 'Team'.<br>
-> The application also contains a 'Reservation Form', using which user can reserve a seat in a Restaurant.<br>
-> The reservation form contains many checks like the First and Last should be less than 3 characters, the email ID should be valid and the phone No must contain 10 digits.<br>
-> In case any of the data checks fail, the application will show a PopUp using React Toast to fix the data.<br>
-> Once the format of all the data input is correct, the Reservation form will get submitted and will show a Success page.<br>
